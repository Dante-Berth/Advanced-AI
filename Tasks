Create a personal github **Done**
Custom my account **Done**
Custom create a export a program **Done** ( it was the just the .gitingore)
Custom different Transformers architectures by modifing the self.architecture :
	- Tensorflow by tfm **Done**
Custom CNN layers **Done**
Custom MLP layers **Done**
Custom RNN layers **Done**

Thesis with Airbus on Geometric data ( GNN <3 asked to Guillaume for more details) **Done**
Create a generic code for auto-optimized layer's hyperparameters thanks to Optuna **Done**
    - Should test for Transformers **Done**
    - Adding my customlayers **Done**
    - Final architecture **Done for the final_layer which is decomposed of two final layers one is composed of four weighted layers while the other is unweighted is composed of two.**
    - Creating a layer for CNN,MLP & RNN for handling a list of two tensors of 3D and 4D **Done**

Custom Optimizers **Keep Adam and try to optimize it with a cosine decay scheduler**
Create **Done**

After succeeding all these tasks, create a meta architecture **To be improved**

Create a function for saving the best model according to validation loss **To Do**

Improve the code **To Do**


Then after succeeding, should launch on our financial data. Then the Neural network would be better than the previous one and we could propose the next AI version to our customers.
