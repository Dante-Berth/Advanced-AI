Create a personal github **Done**
Custom my account **Done**
Custom create a export a program **Done** ( it was the just the .gitingore)
Custom different Transformers architectures by modifing the self.architecture :
	- Tensorflow by tfm **Done**
Custom CNN layers **Done**
Custom MLP layers **Done**
Custom RNN layers **Done**

Thesis with Airbus on Geometric data ( GNN <3 asked to Guillaume for more details) **Done**
Create a generic code for auto-optimized layer's hyperparameters thanks to Optuna **Done**
    - Should test for Transformers **Done**
    - Adding my customlayers **Done**
    - Final architecture **Done for the final_layer which is decomposed of two final layers one is composed of four weighted layers while the other is unweighted is composed of two.**
    - Creating a layer for CNN,MLP & RNN for handling a list of two tensors of 3D and 4D **Done**

Custom Optimizers **To do should i use RL for that ? Do a little review**

After succeeding all these tasks, create a meta architecture **To define**


Then after succeeding, should launch on our financial data.
