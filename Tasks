Create a personal github **Done**
Custom my account **Done**
Custom create a export a program **Done** ( it was the just the .gitingore)
Custom different Transformers architectures by modifing the self.architecture :
	- Tensorflow by tfm **Done**
Custom CNN layers **Done**
Custom MLP layers **Done**
Custom RNN layers **Done**

Thesis with Airbus on Geometric data ( GNN <3 asked to Guillaume for more details)
Create a generic code for auto-optimized layer's hyperparameters thanks to Optuna **In progress**
    - Should test for Transformers **Done**
    - Adding my customlayers **Done**
    - Final architecture
Custom Optimizers
After succeeding all these tasks, create a meta architecture


Then after succeeding, should launch on our financial data.
